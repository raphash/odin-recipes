        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
          <li>In a small bowl whisk together 5 tablespoons melted butter, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon parsley. Place French bread, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Brush butter mixture evenly onto cut sides of bread.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. Do not turn the oven off.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, heat Alfredo sauce in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often. Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan, remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir until butter is melted and ingredients are well combined. Remove from heat.</li>
          <li>Spread half of Alfredo mixture evenly over toasted bread. Add chopped chicken over Alfredo, and top evenly with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, Gruyere, and Monterey Jack cheese.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>To serve, cut into 2-inch  slices. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with remaining Alfredo sauce.</li>
